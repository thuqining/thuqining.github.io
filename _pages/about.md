I am a postdoctoral research scientist in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University, hosted by [Prof. Bolun Xu](https://www.eee.columbia.edu/faculty/bolun-xu). My research interest include data-driven modeling, optimization under uncertainty, and market design for power systems with generalized energy storage (DERs). I am currently serving as the Youth Editorial Board Member of [Power System Protection and Control](www.dlbh.net) and [Energy Storage and Applications](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/esa), and the guest editor of [Processes](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes/special_issues/H1GF9G7324) and [Frontier in Energy Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/65554/advancing-demand-response-in-renewable-smart-grid-for-a-sustainable-future).
    

I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Yanxia Zhang](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/1489.htm) and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Lin Cheng](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/chenglin.htm). Before joining Columbia University, he was a visiting scholar at the Technical University of Denmark in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Pierre Pinson](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/p.pinson) and [Prof. Mads R. Almassalkhi](https://madsalma.github.io/). He was a research associate in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Feng Liu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/fliu.htm). My CV is [here](../files/CV_Ning_Qi__English_.pdf).
